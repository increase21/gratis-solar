            <h3>Do Not Track Disclosure</h3>
            <p class="justify">
                Because an industry-standard Do-Not-Track protocol has not yet been established, Company's information collection 
                practices will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy regardless of any &quot;Do Not Track&quot; signals 
                that may be sent by certain browsers or selected by you. However, you may be able to opt-out of being targeted by 
                certain Third Party Marketers online at www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp. If you wish to opt-out of 
                receiving communications from Company and/or Third Party Marketers, you can follow the opt-out instructions in the 
                respective communications that are sent to you.
            </p>

            <h3>Use of Information</h3>
            <p class="justify">
                We use your personally identifiable information: (a) to offer you auto insurance quotes from the companies we partner with, 
                as well as for our third party marketing partners to offer you other goods and services you may find of interest; (b) to track 
                your compliance with the Terms and Conditions ("Terms and Conditions"); and/or (c) for validation, suppression, content improvement 
                and feedback purposes.
            </p> 
            
            <h3>Information Sharing</h3>
            <p class="justify">
                As a general rule, and other than in connection with the limited exceptions set forth below, we will not sell, share or rent 
                your personally identifiable information to or with others. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may, from time to time, provide 
                such information to certain third-party administrative vendors for efficiency purposes in providing administrative or program 
                management services in connection with your Account, as well as with our third party marketing partners who may have goods and 
                services that interest you. Any third-party vendor or marketing partner so used has agreed to protect the confidentiality of 
                information provided by us. Further, we reserve the right to share your personally identifiable information: (a) where required 
                by law, or requested by a court of competent jurisdiction; (b) in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, 
                assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock; (c) where you are in violation

                in our sole discretion, that such disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or a third party, or necessary to protect us 
                from liability of any kind. The aforementioned includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud 
                protection.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Data Retention</h3>

                do so only for permitted business functions. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information 
                submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic 
                storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
            </p>
