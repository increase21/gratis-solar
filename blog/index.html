                        decreasing after this year.
                        In fact, 2019 is going to be the last year the government will be giving the full 30%
                        funding.</span> Next
                     year this help will be annually reduced by 4%, resulting in only 26% by 2020, 22% by 2021, until
                     finally disappearing by 2022. So this year is your best shot! The perfect time is now!
