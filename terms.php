               Solar savings. We are not involved in the actual transaction between any Prospect and any Provider even though we may, through our Site or other affiliate sites, and with each Prospect's 
                authorization, collect certain information (collectively, a "Lead") about any Prospect and sell such Lead to a Provider. As a result, the quality, safety or legality of the products or services 
                 offered by any Provider for sale, the truth or accuracy of the representations regarding such products or services, the ability of Providers to offer, sell or deliver such products or services 
                  or the ability of Prospects to pay for the products or services offered are solely the responsibility of each user and not IMG. We are an independent contractor for all purposes. We are not

               works on or available through our Sites are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at those locations; (iii) identification of the

                 reasonably sufficient to permit IMG to locate the material; (iv) information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone

                to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. IMG's designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications
                 of claimed infringement is <b>Copyright Agent</b>, 1655 Palm Beach Lakes Blvd., Suite C-1005, West Palm Beach, FL 33401.  For clarity, only DMCA notices should go to the
                  Copyright Agent; any other feedback, comments, requests for technical support, and other communications should be directed to IMG's customer
                   service. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section, your DMCA notice may not be valid.  In the event

Such notification should include: (i) your physical or electronic
                      signature; (ii) identification of the Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the Content
                       appeared before it was removed or disabled; (iii) a statement that you have a good faith belief that the Content was removed or disabled as a 
                       result of mistake or a misidentification of the Content; and  (iv) your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that you
                        consent to the jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, and a statement that you will accept service of 
                        process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.  Furthermore, you should include a clear statement of your acceptance 
                        of process pertaining to the notifying party or the agent of the party as defined in DMCA § 512(c)(1)(C). If a counter-notice is received by the
